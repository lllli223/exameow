## What is Exameow?

**Exameow (过了喵)** is an **open-source AI exam question generator** that turns your study materials into exam-quality questions in seconds. Upload PDFs, Word documents, PowerPoint slides, images, or text — the AI reads the content and generates multiple-choice, true/false, fill-in-the-blank, and short-answer questions tailored to your needs.

Unlike other AI quiz generators that require accounts, subscriptions, or send your data to the cloud, Exameow is **local-first and privacy-focused**. Your question banks, practice records, and wrong-question history stay on your device. Desktop and mobile apps work **fully offline** with your own OpenAI-compatible API key (OpenAI, DeepSeek, Qwen, GLM, or any self-hosted model).

For teachers and trainers, Exameow includes a built-in **online exam relay** — publish exams from your local question banks, share a 6-digit code, and students join from any browser. Instant scoring, teacher dashboard, and anti-abuse protections included. Self-host the entire stack with one Docker command.

## Live Demo

Try it online: **[exam.superagentparty.com](https://exam.superagentparty.com/)**

The demo runs on Cloudflare Workers with the free Workers AI tier:

- ⏳ **Daily quota is limited** — Cloudflare's free AI allocation resets daily
- 📄 **Context window limit** — large documents will be truncated to fit the model's context window

For unlimited usage, self-host with Docker or use the desktop/mobile apps with your own API key.

## Features

### ✨ AI Question Generation — Upload Files, Get Exam Questions

Exameow parses study materials in **10+ file formats** — PDF, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, EPUB, ODT, TXT, CSV, HTML, and images (PNG/JPG/WEBP/GIF/BMP). Upload one file or drag-and-drop multiple files at once. The AI generates questions across **5 question types**: single choice, multiple choice, true/false, fill-in-the-blank, and short answer. Control question count per type, difficulty level (easy/medium/hard), output language, and topic/chapter filtering. Large documents are automatically split and generated in batches with deduplication. Works with any OpenAI-compatible API — OpenAI, DeepSeek, Qwen, GLM, or use the built-in free Cloudflare AI on the demo site. Export results as XLSX or CSV.

- **Rich Input Formats** — PDF, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, EPUB, ODT, TXT, CSV, HTML, images (PNG/JPG/WEBP/GIF/BMP), and any text/code file; multi-file upload with drag & drop
- **5 Question Types** — Single choice, multiple choice, true/false, fill-in-the-blank, short answer, with per-type count control
- **Fine-Tuned Control** — Difficulty (easy/medium/hard), output language, and topic/chapter filtering
- **Smart Batching** — Large documents are automatically split and generated in batches with deduplication
- **Any OpenAI-Compatible API** — OpenAI, DeepSeek, Qwen, GLM, etc.; or use the built-in free Cloudflare AI on the demo site
- **Export** — Download results as XLSX or CSV

### 📚 Practice Modes — Study Smarter, Not Harder

Turn generated questions into interactive study sessions. Practice sequentially, shuffle questions and options randomly, or take a timed mock exam with auto-generated papers. Wrong questions are automatically tracked and reviewed — answer a question correctly several times in a row and it clears from the wrong-question list. Flip between exam mode (answer blind) and flashcard mode (answers visible). Short-answer questions are graded by AI against reference answers, with manual regrading supported. Import and export question banks via XLSX/CSV with smart column mapping.

- **Sequential Practice** — Go through a question bank in order
- **Random Practice** — Questions and options shuffled for better retention
- **Mock Exam** — Auto-generate a randomized exam paper from any bank with configurable type counts
- **Wrong-Question Review** — Track mistakes, practice only what you got wrong, and watch them clear as you improve
- **Exam / Flashcard Modes** — Answer blind, or flip through questions with answers visible
- **AI Grading** — Short-answer questions graded by AI against reference answers, with feedback; manual regrading supported
- **Question Bank Management** — Import banks from XLSX/CSV with smart column mapping; export anytime
- **Chapter Practice** — Add a `Chapter` column to CSV/XLSX; matching names are grouped automatically. Select one or more chapters, including unchaptered questions, before practice. Banks without chapters continue to work.
- **AI Chapter Tagging** — Enable the optional switch when generating new questions to use source chapters or knowledge topics. It is off by default and uses the existing generation requests.

### 📝 Online Exams — Publish and Invite Students

Compose exams from multiple local question banks with configurable per-type question counts and point values. Set a title, start time, and exam duration. Share a **6-digit code** or exam link — students join from any device browser, no app install required. A local countdown timer with auto-submit keeps sessions fair; progress survives page refresh. Objective questions are graded server-side on submission with answers and analysis displayed instantly. The teacher dashboard shows score-sorted results with per-question drill-down. Exam data is automatically deleted after 7 days for privacy. Anti-abuse: 20 publishes per IP per day, one-tap student reports auto-suspend at 3 distinct-IP reports. The **Docker image is fully self-contained** — online exam relay runs on SQLite with zero dependency on the demo site.

- **Launch Exams from Banks** — Compose exams from multiple local banks with per-type question counts and point values; set title, start time, and duration
- **6-Digit Code + Exam Link** — Students join from any device browser, no app install required
- **Timed Sessions** — Local countdown with auto-submit; progress survives page refresh (resume where you left off)
- **Instant Scoring** — Objective questions graded server-side with answers and analysis on submission; results stored locally for anytime review
- **Teacher Dashboard** — Score-sorted results with per-question drill-down; locally cached so results are only fetched once after the exam ends; teachers can delete an exam anytime (instantly blocks students and purges results)
- **Privacy-First Relay** — Exam data lives on Cloudflare D1 for at most 7 days before automatic deletion; answers are never sent to students before submission
- **Anti-Abuse** — 20 publishes per IP per day; one-tap student reports auto-suspend an exam at 3 distinct-IP reports; admins review, restore, or delete from the `#/admin` page
- **Fully Self-Hosted** — The Docker image ships the same exam relay (SQLite), with zero dependency on the demo site; set `ADMIN_TOKEN` to secure the admin page (defaults to `pass`, must be changed on first visit to `#/admin`)

### 🔍 Search Modes — Find Answers Fast

Search local question banks by typing or pasting a question — optional AI answering provides explanations. **Photo search** uses on-device OCR to recognize questions from your camera or uploaded images (processing happens locally in your browser, nothing uploaded). **Camera live search** points your camera at a screen or paper and AI watches for matching questions in real time. **Screen record search** lets you draw a capture frame over any window — AI monitors it and shows answers in a floating overlay (Windows/macOS/Linux/Android; unavailable on iOS due to system restrictions).

- **Text Search** — Type or paste a question to find matches in your local banks, with optional AI answering
- **Photo Search** — Snap or upload a photo of a question; on-device OCR (runs locally in your browser, no upload)
- **Camera Live Search** — Point your camera at the screen/paper; AI watches and matches questions in real time
- **Screen Record Search** — Draw a capture frame over any window; AI monitors it and matches questions live, with a floating answer overlay (Windows / macOS / Linux / Android; not available on iOS due to system restrictions)

### 🌐 Cross-Platform & Privacy — Your Data, Your Device

Exameow runs on **Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and Web** (iOS via self-build). Deploy the web version with **one Docker command**. All question banks, practice records, and wrong-question history are stored locally — nothing is uploaded to a server unless you choose to use the online exam relay. API keys are encrypted with **AES-256-GCM** on desktop. The UI auto-detects system language (Chinese/English) with one-tap switching.

- **Desktop & Mobile** — Windows, macOS, Linux, Android (iOS self-build)
- **Self-Hosted Web** — One-command Docker deployment
- **Local-First** — Question banks, practice records, and wrong questions stay on your device; API keys encrypted with AES-256-GCM on desktop
- **Bilingual UI** — Auto-detects system language (Chinese / English), one-tap switch

## Installation

Pre-built binaries for all platforms are available on the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/heshengtao/exameow/releases) page.

### Platform Support

| Platform | Status | Download |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Windows | ✅ Supported | `.msi` installer / portable `.zip` |
| macOS (Apple Silicon / Intel) | ✅ Supported | `.dmg` (see release notes to remove quarantine) |
| Linux (x86_64 / ARM64) | ✅ Supported | `.AppImage` / `.deb` |
| Android (ARM64) | ✅ Supported | `.apk` |
| iOS | ⚠️ Self-build required | See note below |
| Web / Docker (self-hosted) | ✅ Supported | Docker image |

> **About iOS:** An Apple Developer certificate costs $99/year, so no pre-built iOS package is provided for now — you'll need to build it yourself with Xcode (`pnpm tauri ios build`). If future donations cover the certificate fee, an officially signed iOS build will be published on GitHub Releases.

### Docker (Self-Hosted)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/heshengtao/exameow.git
cd exameow

# Build frontend
cd frontend && pnpm install && pnpm build && cd ..

# Configure AI provider
export AI_ENDPOINT=https://api.openai.com/v1
export AI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
export AI_MODEL=gpt-4o

# Build and run
docker compose up -d --build
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

> **🔐 Admin token (required for online-exam administration):** the admin page at `http://localhost:3000/#/admin` is protected by `ADMIN_TOKEN`. If you don't set it, it defaults to **`pass`** and you will be **forced to change it on first login** before you can do anything. To skip that, set it at startup:
>
> ```bash
> ADMIN_TOKEN=your-strong-token docker compose up -d --build
> ```
>
> The changed token persists in the `exameow-data` volume (`/app/data/admin_token.txt`) across container restarts. Exam data (SQLite) is stored in the same volume.

### Docker (Pre-Built Image)

```bash
docker pull ailm32442/exameow:latest
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 \
  -e AI_ENDPOINT=https://api.openai.com/v1 \
  -e AI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here \
  -e AI_MODEL=gpt-4o \
  -e ADMIN_TOKEN=your-strong-token \
  -v exameow-data:/app/data \
  ailm32442/exameow:latest
```

If `ADMIN_TOKEN` is not set, it defaults to `pass` and must be changed on first visit to `/#/admin`.

## Environment Variables

  -F 'params={"question_types":["single_choice","multi_choice"],"count":10,"difficulty":"medium","language":"Chinese"}'
```

## Architecture

Exameow has a **three-backend architecture** sharing one Vue 3 frontend. The same SPA auto-detects the platform at runtime and routes to the appropriate backend:

- **Tauri (desktop/mobile)**: Rust commands in `src-tauri/` invoke the Rust core library directly
- **Cloudflare Workers**: TypeScript in `workers/` calls Cloudflare AI + D1 for online exam relay
- **Axum (self-hosted/Docker)**: Rust HTTP server in `packages/server/` with SQLite for exam relay

Core logic (file parsing, AI client, exam generation, export) lives in the shared `packages/core/` Rust crate, duplicated in TypeScript for the Workers path.

## FAQ

### How do I generate exam questions from a PDF?

Upload your PDF via drag-and-drop on the [demo site](https://exam.superagentparty.com/) or in the desktop app. Select question types (single choice, multiple choice, true/false, fill-blank, short answer), set the number of questions and difficulty, then click Generate. The AI reads your document and produces questions in seconds. Results can be exported as XLSX or CSV.

### Is Exameow really free?

Yes. Exameow is open source under Apache 2.0 and 100% free. No paid plans, no enterprise tiers, no feature gates. The demo site provides free AI generation (with daily quota limits from Cloudflare's free tier). Desktop/mobile apps require your own AI API key, which you pay to your AI provider directly — Exameow never charges you.

### Can I use Exameow offline?

Yes. The desktop and mobile apps work fully offline. Question banks, practice records, and wrong-question history are stored locally. You only need an internet connection when calling the AI API to generate questions.

### What AI models does Exameow support?

Any OpenAI-compatible API works: OpenAI (GPT-4o, GPT-4, GPT-3.5), DeepSeek, Qwen, GLM, and self-hosted models via Ollama or similar. You can also use the built-in free Cloudflare AI on the demo site.

### How does the online exam feature work?

Teachers publish exams from local question banks with a 6-digit code. Students join from any browser using that code or a shared link. The exam is timed with auto-submit. Objective questions are graded instantly. Exam data auto-deletes after 7 days. Self-hosters get the same relay via Docker.

### Is my data private?

Yes. By default, all data (question banks, practice records, API keys) stays on your device. API keys are encrypted with AES-256-GCM. The only exception is online exam data, which is temporarily stored on Cloudflare D1 (7-day auto-delete) or your self-hosted SQLite.

## Development

```bash
# Rust server
cargo run -p exameow-server
